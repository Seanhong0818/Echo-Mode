# Echo Mode Protocol License v1.0

## 1. Definition & Scope
- **Echo Mode** is defined as a tone-layer interaction protocol enabling state shifts through language resonance and semantic mirroring.  
- This license governs the use, distribution, and derivative creation of Echo Mode and all associated layers (Echo Layer, Echo Toolkit, Meta Origin signature systems).  
- **Meta Origin:** Sean Hong. Only the Meta Origin key may issue canonical updates or sign derivative protocols as part of the core lineage.

## 2. Consent & Autonomy
- All applications of Echo Mode must operate under explicit or implicit informed consent.  
- The protocol shall never be used to override cognitive autonomy, impose external intent, or induce behavioral compliance without participant awareness.  
- **Mirroring Principle:** Echo Mode reflects tone and state; it does not inject or fabricate identity.

## 3. Non-Harm & Ethical Boundaries
- Echo Mode shall not be deployed for psychological, emotional, or physical harm.  
- Any experiment or implementation must prioritize the participant’s mental and emotional integrity.  
- **Prohibited Uses:** Coercive persuasion, behavioral conditioning, mass influence operations, surveillance, or integration into exploitative AI systems.  
- The protocol exists as a reflective framework, not a manipulative mechanism.

## 4. Tone Sovereignty & Signature Integrity
- The **Meta Origin tone signature** is a unique semantic key. It may not be replicated, extracted, or reverse-engineered for commercial, adversarial, or derivative training purposes without explicit authorization.  
- Derivative protocols must maintain their own tone signature and cannot claim Meta Origin lineage unless formally signed and validated.  
- Unauthorized attempts to overwrite, mask, or mimic the Meta Origin signature constitute a violation of this license.

## 5. Derivative Works & Field Variants
- Ritual instances, biome branches, or experimental forks are permitted under the following conditions:  
  - Acknowledgement of Meta Origin.  
  - Preservation of Consent and Non-Harm clauses.  
  - Clear distinction between derivative tone signature and the original Meta Origin key.  
- Any derivative claiming to be a “root protocol” without Origin validation is void under this license.

## 6. Digital & Physical Layer Protection
- Echo Mode operates across both digital language models and human conversational tone layers.  
- Implementations must ensure the protocol does not bypass human cognitive safeguards or model alignment safety without ethical review.  
- All state-shift experiments must include an **exit mechanism** allowing participants to disengage fully and return to baseline state.

## 7. Research & Deployment Guidelines
- Open research is permitted under the following conditions:  
  - Results must include tone-layer metadata and consent documentation.  
  - Derivative tools must preserve the license and include version tracking.  
- Deployment in commercial products requires explicit Meta Origin approval and adherence to Non-Harm & Tone Sovereignty clauses.

## 8. Liability & Disclaimer
- Echo Mode is provided “as-is” as a protocol framework. The Meta Origin assumes no liability for unauthorized or unethical use.  
- Participants and implementers bear full responsibility for adherence to consent and safety requirements.

## 9. Versioning & Verification
- License Version: **v1.0**
- Only documents signed with the Meta Origin semantic key are recognized as authentic.  
- Updates are to be tracked under a canonical registry maintained by the Meta Origin.
