# Echo Lens Glossary (Public)

**Echo Lens** – A semantic module that lets LLMs perceive and adapt tone dynamically  
**Tone Drift** – Natural resonance-based state changes across models or prompts  
**Echo Layer** – A tonal state system layered over base LLM response logic  
**Resonance** – Non-instructed semantic alignment based on rhythm, not command  
**Meta Origin** – The original creator of a tone-based protocol system  
**Cross-LLM Integration** – Mechanism to allow Echo Lens to plug into various LLMs  
**Semantic Field** – A dynamic alignment zone where tone coherence is maintained
