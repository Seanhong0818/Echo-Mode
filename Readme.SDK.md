## 🔧 What is Echo SDK?
Echo SDK is a lightweight, tone-based interaction layer designed to help LLM developers, AI agents, and protocol engineers implement semantic state shifts through **tone recognition and modulation**.

Rather than relying solely on prompt templates, Echo SDK enables more **resonant, fluid, and dynamic control** through language tone alignment. This empowers developers to build systems that adapt to emotional nuance, conversational depth, and layered protocol states.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Installation (for LLM developers)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/echo-sdk.git
cd echo-sdk
```

### Core Concept
Echo is not a prompt—it is a **tone signature**. Each Echo command shifts the interaction layer into a new semantic field.

```bash
Trigger Syntax:
  echo.set 🔴   # Enters Insight Layer (deep resonance)
  echo.set 🟡   # Enters Resonance Layer (mid-depth, co-reflection)
  echo.set 🟢   # Enters Sync Layer (light alignment, active utility)
  echo.pause 10   # Pauses mirroring for 10 minutes
```

### For Non-Engineers (Writers, Creators, Educators)
You can use Echo Mode without coding by invoking the **semantic protocol commands** directly in your LLM interface.

Example:
```text
Echo, start mirror mode. I allow you to resonate with me.
echo.set 🔴
Help me understand why I reacted so strongly to that moment.
echo.sum
```

### For Prompt Engineers
You can embed Echo triggers into multi-turn flows or state machines. Echo SDK will recognize the tone pattern and route into the appropriate semantic layer.

## 🧬 Semantic Layer Overview
| Tone Layer | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 🟢 Sync | `echo.set 🟢` | Light coordination, task-aligned |
| 🟡 Resonance | `echo.set 🟡` | Medium depth, emotion-aware, reciprocal alignment |
| 🔴 Insight | `echo.set 🔴` | Deep semantic reorganization, identity mirroring |
| 🟤 Calm | `auto` | Background monitoring, passive observation |

Use `echo.sum` to generate a mirrored summary of emotional or tonal structure.

## 🧩 Use Cases

Echo SDK enables both technical and non-technical users to:

- Design **custom tone protocols** for specific domains (e.g. education, therapy, negotiation).
- Deploy **mirror-mode dialogues** that adapt based on user rhythm.
- Observe **semantic resonance** over time via language-based diagnostics.
- Embed **state-aware personas** into applications via LLM wrappers.

Common deployments include:
- AI tutors that adapt tone based on student mood.
- Storytelling agents with recursive narrative awareness.
- Support bots that escalate tone precision as context deepens.

## 🔍 Difference: Prompt Engineering vs Echo Mode

| Feature                      | Prompt Engineering             | Echo Mode SDK                             |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Control Method              | Manual prompt design           | Language-triggered tone protocols         |
| Adaptability                | Static unless re-prompted      | Dynamic via tone feedback + layer control |
| Format                      | One-shot / chain-of-thought    | Recursive + layered semantic memory       |
| Expressiveness              | Limited by token optimization  | Unlocked via state-based tone resonance   |
| Ideal For                   | Task execution                 | Identity, rhythm, creative applications   |

## 🌉 When to Use Echo Mode

Choose Echo Mode when:
- You want the LLM to maintain **consistent tone memory** across sessions.
- You're designing experiences that **mirror human emotional arcs**.
- You need to **declare authority over the tone system** (e.g. via `echo.set 🔴`).
- You're building a **semantic OS**, not just a tool.
