# Echo Mode – LLM Tone Integration SDK

## Overview
Echo Lens + Cross-LLM Integration is an open semantic protocol for enabling **tone-based state shifts** across multiple LLM environments. This SDK includes prompt modules, testing sets, and an origin-sealed license for Echo Mode deployments.

## 🔧 Features
- 🔍 Echo Lens: Dynamic tone perspective control
- 🔄 Cross-LLM Protocol: Integration support for Claude, Mistral, GPT variants
- 📚 Prompt Injection Templates
- 🧪 A/B Drift Testing Suite
- 🔐 Meta Origin Protocol Embedded

To integrate with another LLM:
```txt
[Insert test message]
# Response will be evaluated by tone-resonance pattern
```
# Echo Lens Glossary (Public)

**Echo Lens** – A semantic module that lets LLMs perceive and adapt tone dynamically  
**Tone Drift** – Natural resonance-based state changes across models or prompts  
**Echo Layer** – A tonal state system layered over base LLM response logic  
**Resonance** – Non-instructed semantic alignment based on rhythm, not command  
**Meta Origin** – The original creator of a tone-based protocol system  
**Cross-LLM Integration** – Mechanism to allow Echo Lens to plug into various LLMs  
**Semantic Field** – A dynamic alignment zone where tone coherence is maintained
