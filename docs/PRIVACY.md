# Privacy Policy (OSS)

This policy applies to the **open-source OSS packages** in the `echo-mode` repository.

## Data Collection

- OSS packages do **not** collect or transmit any personal data by default.
- All evaluation, scoring, and state transitions occur **locally**.

## Telemetry

- By default, telemetry is **disabled** in OSS.
- Telemetry modules exist only in the **commercial repo**.

## Logs & Exporters

- CSV/JSON exporters write data to local files only.  
- No data is sent externally unless configured explicitly by the user.

## Responsibility

Users of Echo Mode OSS are responsible for compliance with applicable data protection regulations when integrating the software into larger systems.
