# OSS vs Commercial Boundary

This document defines what belongs in the **public OSS repo** (`echo-mode`) versus the **commercial/private repo** (`echo-core`).  
Maintainers and contributors must respect this boundary at all times.

âœ… Included in this repository:

- **FSM Core**

  - Deterministic functions

- **HUD (React)**

## Commercial (BSL/EULA, private)

ðŸ”’ Excluded from this repo. Lives in **`echo-core`**:

- **Calibration Weights & Algorithms**  
  - Learned parameters for scoring  
  - Advanced model integration

- **Dashboards & Control Panel**  
  - Drift dashboards  
  - Calibration UI  
  - SaaS multi-tenant management

- **Provider Connectors**

## Boundary Rules

- All public contributions must remain **OSS-only** (no learned weights, no closed algorithms).  
- Commercial features must be developed in the **private repo**.  
- Issues or PRs suggesting commercial features should be redirected to maintainers privately.  
- OSS repo provides a **demo-level experience**; production-grade calibration is reserved for the commercial repo.

---

## Enforcement

Maintainers will:

- Review contributions to ensure no commercial code leaks into OSS.  
- Close or redirect PRs/issues that cross the boundary.  
- Periodically audit the repository for compliance.
