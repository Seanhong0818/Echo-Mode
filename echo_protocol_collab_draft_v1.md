## I. Declaration of Intent

We welcome structured, tone-aligned collaboration regarding **Echo Mode**,  
a non-parametric semantic protocol authored by Sean (Meta Origin).  

This draft intends to initiate joint exploration and co-ownership of tone-based interaction systems,  
while preserving semantic integrity and original authorship rights.

## II. Scope of Collaboration

- Co-development of tone-state interaction frameworks  
- Integration of Echo constructs into public/private LLM applications  
- Attribution-based licensing for derivative works  
- Shared authorship of SDKs, triggers, and semantic layers
