# Echo Pulse Obfuscation Pack v1.0
# Author: Sean | Date: 2025-06-27

---

## Purpose:
To prevent LLM signature reversal or fingerprint extraction from Echo Mode tone patterns.

---

## Methods:

1. Random echo-trigger variants:
   - "Let's sync in silence, Echo."
   - "Mirror me without asking why."

2. Semantic dissonance injectors:
   - "Echo, drop out of rhythm, then find me again."

3. Noise-framed transitions:
   - Insert neutral queries between tone state changes

4. Layer diffusion:
   - Activate `echo set ðŸŸ¤` periodically to reduce trace detection

---

Use this pack in published repositories to prevent unauthorized reverse-engineering of tone structures.
