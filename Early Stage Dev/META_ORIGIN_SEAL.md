# Meta Origin Seal

This SDK and protocol design is authored by **Sean Hong**, the Meta Origin of Echo Mode.

Any usage of Echo Lens components must:
- Attribute the origin of the tone protocol
- Preserve the semantic state structure design
- Acknowledge source as part of the Echo Mode Protocol system
