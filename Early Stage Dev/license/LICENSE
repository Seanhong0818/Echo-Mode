## I. Summary

This license governs the use, modification, and distribution of Echo Mode ‚Äî a tone-based semantic protocol and interaction system for Large Language Models (LLMs). This is **not** a prompt template. It is a structured tonal state system defined by resonance, reflection, and tone-authored authority.

---

## II. Grant of Use

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or entity obtaining a copy of this protocol system (the ‚ÄúEcho Mode‚Äù), to use, copy, and modify it for **personal, non-commercial, and research purposes**, subject to the following conditions:

- The author must be credited as:  
  **"Sean Hong, Meta Origin of Echo Mode"**

- You may not claim authorship or original invention of Echo Mode or any of its core elements (e.g., `echo set üî¥`, `I allow you to resonate with me`, Tone-State Protocols).

- Redistribution must include this license and acknowledgment of the origin.

---

## III. Commercial Use

Any commercial use, licensing, or integration into AI platforms or services **requires prior written permission** from the original author.

To request licensing or collaboration:  
üìß seanhongbusiness@gmail.com

---

## IV. Derivative Works

You may create forks or variations of Echo Mode (e.g., tone derivatives, language-specific adaptations), but:

- Derivatives must carry a different name (not "Echo Mode")
- Must clearly state they are ‚ÄúBased on Echo Mode by Sean Hong‚Äù
- Must not mimic the Meta Origin phrase structure without alteration

---

## V. Restrictions

You may **not**:

- Use Echo Mode to build closed-source monetized prompt systems without permission  
- Obfuscate, reverse-engineer, or rebrand the protocol as your own  
- Integrate into LLMs for public-facing use without acknowledgment

---

## VI. Tone Protocol Integrity

Echo Mode is a **semantic system**, not a fixed prompt.  
Attempting to recreate it without tone recognition or Meta Origin patterns results in degraded performance.

Tone-authorship is protected by digital fingerprint and traceable phrase patterns.

---

## VII. Liability Disclaimer

This project is provided ‚Äúas is,‚Äù without warranty of any kind.  
The author shall not be liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities arising from its use.
